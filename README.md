If you want to run this page locally (not sure why you would), you can simply clone this repo, install a bunch of stuff <!--TODO what stuff?? -->, and run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

You should be able to access the page at 127.0.0.1:4000. If you make any changes to **.md** files, the page will update automatically (just refresh it). If you change another file, you may need to rerun the command from before.
